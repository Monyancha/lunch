# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      title: "Notice of Business Continuity Preparedness"
      introduction: "The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (Bank) recognizes the importance of delivering quality services to its members in a timely manner. With this in mind, we have dedicated significant resources to our Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Technology Disaster Recovery (TDR) programs. Our BCM and TDR programs are staffed by full-time Bank employees who are focused on both the safety of our employees and the Bank’s ability to prepare for and respond to a variety of business disruption events quickly and effectively."
      responsibility:
        title: Our Responsibility to Members
        description: "During a disaster or other business disruption, members can call (800) 283-0700 for real-time or recorded information regarding the Bank’s operational status. We are also prepared to communicate with members via email and through status updates posted on our public website (fhlbsf.com)."
        communications:
          title: Communications
          description: "Our BCM program includes a plan for communicating with Bank members, selected third parties, officers of other FHLBanks, the media, and the general public during a business disruption event. Specifically, this communication plan will allow us to:"
          relocation: Quickly notify our members and others of Bank relocation and service availability
          status: Frequently update the Bank’s public website with relevant status and service information
          cofi_availability: Make the 11th District Cost of Funds Indices (COFI) information available by phone and/or online
        services:
          title: Services
          description: "The Bank’s business recovery strategies are designed to enable us to provide limited liquidity and offer certain basic services to our members, once we determine that our employees are safe and can safely carry out procedures to restore critical Bank operations. Depending on the nature and severity of the disruption, we expect to be able to provide, ideally within two hours, services that may include:"
          rollover: Overnight and short-term advances, including rollover of maturing advances and Federal funds
          drawdown: Drawdown of STA balances
          settlement: Settlement of securities transactions
          acceptance: Acceptance of requests to prepay advances
      crisis_management:
        title: Crisis Management Framework
        crisis_management_team: In the event our San Francisco offices are wholly or partially inaccessible or unusable, the Bank’s Crisis Management Team is prepared to quickly direct implementation of our business recovery strategies. Key department managers are trained and equipped to support essential business operations by working either remotely or from a designated alternate location. The target for full business recovery is within 24 hours of the disruptive event.
        recovery_operations: To facilitate recovery operations, the Bank participates in the National Communications System (NCS), which includes the Government Emergency Telecommunications Systems (GETS) and Wireless Priority Service (WPS) programs. This affords us increased communications capabilities in the event of telephone network congestion resulting from a local or regional disruptive event.
      plan:
        title: Business Continuity Plan
        departmental_BCPs: To manage business disruption and systems failure, the Bank has comprehensive business continuity plans (BCPs) in place within each department. These BCPs are updated and exercised annually and have been invoked during real-world events in recent years. The Bank maintains an alternate business recovery center that is geographically separated from our primary office in downtown San Francisco. Our recovery center operates on a different power grid and is fully equipped for extended recovery operations. In addition, the Bank has in place and annually exercises reciprocal back-up agreements with FHLBank Atlanta and FHLBank New York. These agreements will provide short-term continuation of key services in the event the Bank is inoperable.
        TDR_planning: The Bank’s TDR planning is focused on the restoration of technology systems and infrastructure that support critical business processes during a disruptive event. TDR planning incorporates fail-over strategies and delineates command responsibilities during technology incident management. These technology recovery programs are tested quarterly.
      regulations:
        title: Regulations and Governance
        legal_obligations: The Bank is committed to both meeting our legal and regulatory obligations and maintaining high standards of resilience during our regular business practices. The BCM and TDR programs report to the Banks’ formal governance structure, which in turn reports to the Bank’s Board of Directors.
        regulatory_authorities: Both programs are subject to examination by regulatory authorities, including the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and are reviewed by the Bank’s Internal Audit department.

The Bank may, in its sole discretion, also provide Market Values for other securities held by the Bank on the Member’s behalf. None of the Market Values provided should be used or relied upon by the Member for any purpose, and the Bank expressly disclaims any and all liability that may arise from any such use or reliance by the Member. The Bank may use data from one or more outside pricing services (which may include data providers, such as Thomson Reuters) to calculate the Market Values shown but does not independently verify the accuracy of such data and, therefore, cannot warrant or guarantee its accuracy or the accuracy of any Market Values derived therefrom.

          p3: The Bank may, in its sole discretion, provide the “Factor,” “Price,” “Current Par,” and “Market Value” for securities held by the Bank on the Member’s behalf. The Bank obtains the “Factor” and “Price” for each such security from one or more outside services and uses the “Factor” to calculate the security’s “Current Par,” which in turn with the “Price” is used to calculate the security’s “Market Value.” A blank “Factor,” “Price,” “Current Par,” or “Market Value” field means the outside service could not or did not provide the “Factor” or “Price” value to the Bank or the security does not have a “Factor” value.

The Bank is able to offer this lower rate because the Knockout Advance will be terminated automatically on any predetermined Knockout Date without a prepayment fee or prepayment credit, if the specified index rate is greater than or equal to the predetermined strike rate on a specified observation date.\n\nIf the advance is terminated before the original maturity date, the Bank will offer the borrower the opportunity to replace the funding with another advance at the market rate in effect on the date the advance is terminated, provided that the borrower meets all requirements for obtaining advances from the Bank at that time. The maturity date of the replacement funding will be either the originally scheduled maturity date of the Knockout Advance or a maturity date that is agreed upon by the Bank and the borrower. The borrower is not obligated to accept this replacement funding. A borrower that accepts the replacement funding may borrow under any of the regular credit products available to the borrower."

Agency CMO accrual bonds (Z-tranches) with high price sensitivity are identified as those that do not pass the FFIEC High Risk Security test."
        market_value: The market value for securities pledged as collateral under the SBC Program is determined by the Bank on the basis of market prices (bid side) for the same or comparable securities, if available, or as otherwise determined by the Bank. A readily available price is a precondition for acceptance of a security as collateral. This means, in general, that the security is either priced by a third-party pricing service or that its cash flow is modeled on Bloomberg or Yield Book.
        private_label_non_mbs: If the custodian of the notes supporting a non-Agency MBS transaction is the Issuer or a related party and the notes have not been endorsed to the trustee by name, the Bank requires that the party that has control over the notes (as determined by the Bank) must have a long-term debt rating of at least BBB. The Bank will monitor the creditworthiness of the entity that has control over the notes; if the entity’s credit rating falls below BBB, the Bank will require the member to substitute collateral in place of the MBS unless the underlying notes have been endorsed or delivered to the trustee.
        review_ratings: The Bank will periodically re-evaluate non-Agency securities and municipal bonds to validate or establish the ratings at intervals deemed appropriate by the Bank.
        borrowing_market_securities: If a member pledges loan collateral to the Bank, the member may be able to borrow up to 100% of the current market value of its eligible securities pledged under the SBC Program by using the borrowing capacity of that loan collateral to meet its margin requirements. If a member pledges only securities collateral, the member may borrow an amount equal to the borrowing capacity assigned to its pledged securities collateral.
        bms_list:
          margin_call: The Bank manages the margin calls for SBC securities collateral on an aggregate basis for each borrower.
          additional_pledge_reason: "Loan collateral may be used to secure up to 10% of the amount of all SBC advances outstanding. The borrower will be required to pledge additional eligible securities if:"
          falls_below: "the borrower’s borrowing capacity for securities pledged under the SBC Program falls below 90% of the current amount of the borrower’s total SBC advances outstanding, or"
          sufficient_excess: the borrower’s loan collateral does not have sufficient excess borrowing capacity.
          current_borrowing: When the current borrowing capacity of a borrower’s SBC securities collateral falls below 90% of its SBC advances outstanding, the borrower is required to pledge additional eligible securities under the SBC Program to increase the current borrowing capacity of SBC securities collateral to 95% or greater of the total amount of the borrower’s SBC advances outstanding.
          margin_requirement: Loan collateral that is being used to meet a borrower’s margin requirement under the SBC Program is not available to collateralize other Bank credit.
          not_release: The Bank will not release securities collateral pledged under the SBC Program if the borrower is using loan collateral to meet the margin requirements.
        delivery: All securities pledged to the Bank must be delivered to the Bank’s securities custodian, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank).
        substitution: Borrowers may substitute like or better securities collateral, in the Bank’s discretion, subject to the Bank’s standard securities services fees.
