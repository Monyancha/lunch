# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

The Bank may use data from one or more outside pricing services (which may include data providers, such as Thomson Reuters) to calculate the Market Values shown but does not independently verify the accuracy of such data and, therefore, cannot warrant or guarantee its accuracy or the accuracy of any Market Values derived therefrom.

The Bank obtains the "Factor" and "Price" for each such security from one or more outside services and uses the "Factor" to calculate the security's "Current Par," which in turn with the "Price" is used to calculate the security's "Market Value." A blank "Factor," "Price," "Current Par or "Market Value" field means the outside service could not or did not provide the "Factor" or "Price" value to the Bank or the security does not have a "Factor" value.

Discount notes are the primary short-term debt instruments used by the System and are issued using a variety of methods, including periodic auctions. The Office of Finance currently issues discount notes with maturities of 4, 9, 13, and 26 weeks via the auction method. The discount note auctions are usually held twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Settlement of the discount notes sold at auction is usually the business day following the auction date. However, the discount note auctions are subject to change at any time without notice, as determined by the Office of Finance."

In selecting an alternate index when the discount note auction has not occurred as scheduled for any reason, the Bank, in its sole discretion, may select as a repricing index any of the following:"

        call_option_premium: The present value of 5 basis points per annum for the remaining term to maturity applied against the principal amount of the advance being repaid. The Bank's cost of funds, as determined by the Bank in its sole discretion, will be used to determine present values.
        special_notice: "The DN Auction-Indexed Advance has a risk profile that may be inappropriate for some institutions. The availability of the index to which this product is tied is subject to uncertainty, and the actual interest rate charged for this advance initially and at repricing may be based on an estimated cost of alternate funding depending on market conditions and the actual results of the System discount note auction. In addition, there is no limit to the size of the Bank's request or other FHLBanks' requests for System discount notes in the auctions, and large participation by the Bank or by other FHLBanks could increase the average cost of System discount notes sold (compared to a lower participation amount). \n\n This information is not intended as investment advice. The decision to obtain an DN Auction-Indexed Advance and the analysis of how it may fit into a borrower's financial or business strategy remain solely the borrower's responsibility."

This structure allows the Bank to offer the member a rate that may be significantly lower than the rate for a comparable Fixed Rate Credit Advance, but with more certainty as to when the advance will be terminated than with a Putable Advance.\n\nThe Knockout Advance has a fixed rate that may be below the market rate for a comparable Fixed Rate Credit Advance, depending on the selected strike rate. The Bank is able to offer this lower rate because the Knockout Advance will be terminated automatically on any predetermined Knockout Date without a prepayment fee or prepayment credit, if the specified index rate is greater than or equal to the predetermined strike rate on a specified observation date.\n\nIf the advance is terminated before the original maturity date, the Bank will offer the borrower the opportunity to replace the funding with another advance at the market rate in effect on the date the advance is terminated, provided that the borrower meets all requirements for obtaining advances from the Bank at that time. The maturity date of the replacement funding will be either the originally scheduled maturity date of the Knockout Advance or a maturity date that is agreed upon by the Bank and the borrower. The borrower is not obligated to accept this replacement funding. A borrower that accepts the replacement funding may borrow under any of the regular credit products available to the borrower."

        title: Other Cash Needs (OCN) Advance
        description: The OCN Advance is a Variable Rate Credit (VRC) Advance option for members that, as a result of an unexpected development, need a short-term advance and either do not have a Financing Availability or have used it fully. In addition, the Bank, in its sole discretion, may fund an OCN Advance to cover the amount of any Settlement/Transaction Account (STA) overdraft.
        uses:
          financing: To meet funding needs that exceed a member's Financing Availability
        advantages:
          fund: Fund unexpected cash needs
          same_day: Same-day access if notice received by 10 a.m.
        eligibility: The Bank will determine member eligibility for an OCN Advance on a case-by-case basis. The member must identify the need for the OCN and the repayment sources.
        maximum_ammount: "5% of member's total assets."
        maximum_term: "45 days"
        interest_rate: The initial interest rate is the rate set for VRC Advances on the date of funding. OCN Advances are repriced daily.
        interest_day_count: "Actual/Actual (Actual/360 for Securities-Backed Credit Program)"
        interest_payment_frequency: At monthend and at repayment

      putable:
        title: Putable Advance
        description: "The Putable Advance is a specially priced term advance in which the Bank retains the right to “put” (terminate) the advance at the Bank’s discretion. This structure allows the Bank to offer the member a rate that may be significantly lower than the rate for a comparable Fixed Rate Credit Advance.\n\nThe Putable Advance has a fixed rate that is below the market rate for a comparable Fixed Rate Credit Advance. The Bank is able to offer this lower rate because with the Putable Advance, the Bank retains the right to terminate, at the Bank’s discretion, the advance before its originally scheduled maturity on any predetermined Put Date. If the Bank exercises its right to terminate before maturity, the Bank will offer the borrower the opportunity to replace the funding with another advance at the market rate in effect on the Put Date when the Bank exercises its right, provided that the borrower meets all requirements for obtaining advances from the Bank at that time. The maturity date of the replacement funding will be either the originally scheduled maturity date of the Putable Advance or a maturity date that is agreed upon by the Bank and the borrower. The borrower is not obligated to accept this replacement funding. A borrower that accepts the replacement funding may borrow under any of the regular credit options available to the borrower."
        use: Lower your cost of funds
        advantage: Take advantage of a lower interest rate
        features: "Because of the special risk characteristics of the Putable Advance, the Bank offers this product only to preapproved borrowers on an order-only basis. The actual terms and conditions of the advance are determined when the advance is made and are set forth in the Confirmation of Advance for each Putable Advance. General features of the advance are as follows:"
        eligibility_html: "Members that are well capitalized, have a consistent record of good earnings, and have minimal problem assets are generally eligible to use the Putable Advance. A <a href=%{url}>Statement of Authority: Putable Advances</a> (PDF) signed by an authorized officer must be submitted to the Bank before any transactions may be executed."
        bank_terminate: "The Bank will have the right to terminate only the entire Putable Advance (no partial terminations) on any Put Date and will provide at least 2 business days’ prior notice, by telephone and in writing by confirmed fax, using the modified following business day convention.* If the Bank exercises its right to terminate, the member must repay the entire advance on the Put Date selected by the Bank. The Bank will offer to make available replacement funding, subject to the conditions described above."
        total_max_amount_borrow: The total maximum amount per borrower that may be available is equal to three times the borrower's current Tier 1 capital for FDIC-insured institutions, three times the borrower's current net worth for NCUA-insured institutions, or a comparable amount for other borrowers, as determined by the Bank.
        maximum_term: 10 Years
        interest_day_count: Actual/360
        interest_payment_frequency: Quarterly and at repayment
        put_lockout_period: "Typically 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year (Other lockout periods may be available.)"
        put_dates: Typically the Put Dates are the same as the interest payment dates, after the put lockout period.
        prepayment_features_html: "Before the advance is made, the borrower may have the option of selecting one of two prepayment alternatives: the standard prepayment formula or the prepayment formula for advances with a partially symmetric prepayment feature. The borrower must submit to the Bank the <a href=%{url}>Statement of Authority: Advances with Partial Prepayment Symmetry</a> (PDF) signed by an authorized officer before any advances with partial prepayment symmetry may be executed."
        special_notice: "The Putable Advance has a complex risk profile and may be an inappropriate product for some institutions. The expected maturity of the Putable Advance may contract or extend adversely to market movements, and the Bank makes no representations as to (i) the expected life of the advance or (ii) the criteria behind the exercise of the Bank’s right to terminate the Putable Advance. This information is not intended as investment advice. The decision to obtain a Putable Advance and the analysis of how it may fit into a borrower’s financial or business strategy remain solely the borrower’s responsibility.\n\nNotwithstanding any lockout period for exercising its right to terminate the Putable Advance, the Bank reserves all of its rights under the Advances and Security Agreement, including, without limitation, its right to terminate the Putable Advance and accelerate repayment of the advance and its right to liquidate collateral pledged by the borrower as security for the Putable Advance at any time upon the occurrence of an event of default described in the Advances and Security Agreement.\n\n* If the period end date falls on a non-business day, the period end date will be the first following business day, unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the period end date will be the first preceding business day."
